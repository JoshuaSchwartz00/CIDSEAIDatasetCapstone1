Script file name = WikiHow_recipes_6.py


## Prerequisites:
You need to install and setup on your PC:
* Python 3
* Google Chrome browser
* Chromedriver for your version of Chrome from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
* Selenium library for Python from https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html. Do "pip install selenium"

## Instructions: 
The above script will generate about 750 json files plus images 
with data scraped from WikiHow recipes.
* On line 6/7 of the script there is a PATH variable. You need to update this variable to be the path to "chromedriver.exe" on your PC.
* Create a folder where you want the generated files to be stored.
* Copy the python script to that folder and run it through the command line, i.e. "python3 WikiHow_recipes_6.py"
* Wait for the script to finish. This may take 15-20 minutes.

## Naming:
The script names the json and images like so: "category0recipe0method0.json" and "category0recipe0method0image0.webp".
Category means the type or genre of the recipe, and WikiHow has a recipe catalogue page for each category:
* 0 - Recipes (in general), https://www.wikihow.com/Category:Recipes
* 1 - Desserts and Sweets, https://www.wikihow.com/Category:Desserts-and-Sweets
* 2 - Meat, https://www.wikihow.com/Category:Meat
* 3 - Baking, https://www.wikihow.com/Category:Baking
* 4 - Fish and Seafood, https://www.wikihow.com/Category:Fish-and-Seafood
* 5 - Pasta and Noodles, https://www.wikihow.com/Category:Pasta-and-Noodles 
	
Recipe refers to the Nth recipe in a category. Method refers to the Nth sub-method within a recipe
since some recipes list multiple methods for how to do them. Image refers to the Nth image for that recipe method.


## Count How Many JSON Files
To see how many json files there are, you can run this (in Windows Powershell):
    "(Get-ChildItem -filter *.json | Measure-Object).Count"
